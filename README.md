# n8n-iamsafe

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of n8n workflow automations for organizational safety check-ins and emergency response, designed to be easily adapted for any company. The workflows leverage Slack, Google Sheets, and (optionally) OpenAI for automated communication and tracking of employee safety status during emergencies.

## Dynamic Value Replacement

To adapt these workflows for your organization, you must replace hardcoded values with your own:

- **Google Sheets Document IDs & Sheet Names:**
  - Replace all `documentId` and `sheetName` values with your own Google Sheet IDs and sheet/tab names.

- **Slack Channel IDs:**
  - Replace all `channelId` values (e.g., `C0918AFJ2J3`) with your own HR Slack channel ID.
- **Slack User IDs:**
  - If you use direct user notifications, ensure user IDs are dynamically mapped from your Slack workspace (Use the "IAMSAFE - SlackID to Email Mapper" workflow to help you achive this).
- **Email Domains:**
  - Update any email domain logic to match your organization (e.g., `@fullpath.com` â†’ your domain).
- **RSS Feed URL:**
  - Update the RSS feed URL in the Main Automation to a relevant source for your region or use case.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Import Workflows:**
   - In n8n, import each JSON file as a new workflow.
2. **Import Sheets and Data:**
   - Copy the Google Sheets examples from the "example_sheets" folder and populate the "example_employees_list" with your employee data. *City names must be in "Hebrew" to work with "Hebrew" RSS Feed source.
3. **Configure Credentials:**
   - Set up Google Sheets, Slack, and (optionally) OpenAI credentials on n8n as described above.
4. **Update Dynamic Values:**
   - Edit each workflow to replace document IDs, sheet names, channel IDs, and any other organization-specific values.
5. **Share Google Sheets:**
   - Ensure the Google Sheets are shared with the account used for the OAuth2 credential.
6. **Test Each Workflow:**
   - Use manual triggers or test events to verify each workflow end-to-end.
7. **Activate Workflows:**
   - Once tested, activate the workflows in n8n for production use.
